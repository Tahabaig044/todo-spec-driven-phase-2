[post_write_hooks]
# post_write_hooks defines scripts or Python functions that are to be
# executed whenever a "revision" command generates a new revision file.
# The entry point is expected to be either a script path or a callable
# object.  Please refer to the documentation to see "post_write_hooks"
# for details on how to set up this option.
